# Histogram-Equalization

Histogram Equalization: In image analysis/image processing, histogram equalization (and a related concept, histogram matching) is a common tool used to enhance the contrast in images with poor contrast. Consider a gray-scale image. If the intensity of the pixels in the image is treated as a random variable (say X), the histogram of intensity values would be an approximation of the pdf of the intensity R.V. In histogram equalization, the goal is often to
modify the random variable (pixel intensities in this case) through a transformation, say Y = g(X), such that after the transformation, the new random variable (Y ) represents intensity values of a new (transformed) image whose resulting histogram (think pdf) is flat (uniform). This results in areas of the image with poor contrast to result in greater contrast. A modification of this approach, called histogram matching, instead finds a mapping Y = g(X) such that the pdf/histogram of the modified data Y matches any desired “target” pdf/histogram (not just a uniform pdf). This concept is commonly used in many photo-editing apps, where such a transformation is used to modify the histogram to a desired “target” histogram.
In this problem, you are required to understand and utilize histogram equalization on the grayscale images provided to you.
